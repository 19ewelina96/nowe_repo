refren-2.txt

Won't you stay
Won't you stay
Slowly, slowly you run for me
But do you know me at all
Someone told me love controls everything
But only if you know

'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If you don't wanna try
But all that I've been thinking of
Is maybe that you might
And babe, it looks as though we're running out of words to say
And love's floating away
